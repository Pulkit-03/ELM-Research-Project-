# ML-Algorithms: Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)

## Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and exploration of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm, known for its single hidden layer approach that enables rapid learning. The project applies ELM across multiple domains, including classification and regression, with specific use cases like email spam classification and stock price prediction.

## Features

- **Rapid Learning**: Fast training times compared to traditional neural networks.
- **Single Hidden Layer**: Simplified network architecture while maintaining performance.
- **Versatile Applications**: Implemented in tasks like email spam detection and stock price prediction.
